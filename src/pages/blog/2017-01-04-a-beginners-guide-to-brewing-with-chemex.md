# How To Become The Best Version Of Yourself: Part One

## Backstory

For as long as I can remember, I had always been fat, depressed & lonely. For this reason *(and a million others),* I failed to pick up many hobbies and build meaningful relationships with the people around me, even my family.

During my first serious relationship, whenever I was without my girlfriend I would continue to live with that huge feeling of dread. You know the feeling, the one that feels like an anchor laying in your stomach, keeping you paralysed in bed — unable to face the world. I would smoke more and eat more junk food, just to get a momentary escape from the pain that seemed to be my life.

So at the age of 19, when she broke up with me after months of arguing, I hit an all time low. At that point in my life, this felt like the worst thing to ever happen to me. I felt as though my life was doomed for failure. No matter how hard I tried, no matter how much I wanted things to change, I just couldn’t feel happy.

Looking back now, I realise that I was young and dramatic. However the pain and suffering I felt during that time was nonetheless very real and it triggered a major turning point in my life.

It’s been just over 2 years since then and a lot has changed:

* I’ve lost over 100 pounds and transformed the way I look and feel about myself

* I’ve moved to Australia and doubled my salary at an amazing job in Sydney as a UI Developer

* I’ve picked up a bunch of new skills, such as kickboxing, music production, and UI/UX design

* My relationship with my family has never been better and, despite living on the other side of the world, I have great relationships both in Australia and back at home in the UK

* I have a new girlfriend, and we have a much happier and healthier relationship than my previous experience

* Most importantly, ***I’m happier and achieving more than I have ever been!***

I don’t want to give the impression that I’m something I’m not. I still have a long way to go before I would consider myself successful but, compared to the person I was only a few years ago, I can proudly say I am now a better version of myself.

At 21 years old, the life I’m currently living was consciously designed and brought in to reality by me, my mindsets and behaviour have made this so. I’m a firm believer that we are all where we are right now because of the way we think and act in the world.

What I want to get across is, regardless of where you are in life right now, feel empowered because you are *always* in control and have the power to make change *at any time*.

## Adopt Responsibility For Your Life

To become the best version of yourself, you firstly need to understand and accept that life is full of suffering — it just is. There’s nothing you can do about it. Everyone you love will eventually die, some of them prematurely. You will be made redundant from a job you worked your arse off for. The world is unequal and many people in power are corrupt and take advantage of the poor. War, poverty, racism, sexism and homophobia exist.

Life doesn’t discriminate, these are issues that everyone has to face over the years. So what are you going to do about it? Well, first of all, you are going to stop playing the victim because it will get you nowhere. ***No one is going to save you but yourself***. The only logical option is to try and reduce the suffering by taking responsibility for your circumstances.
> # *It may not be your fault, but it is *always* your responsibility to change it.*

### Make A Commitment

So you’re taking on responsibility, you are no longer a victim — you’re a hero. There are aspects of your life that you know are fucked up. In my case, I was overweight and had been for a very long time, making me feel worthless and unable to fit in.

Maybe you have toxic relationships (family, friends or romantic) in your life that constantly put you down. Or perhaps you have a dead end job and your boss is an arsehole that doesn’t appreciate your hard work. Your situation may be even more fucked up than either of those.

These are tough predicaments to be in and such situations will likely make you feel miserable on a daily basis. But ask yourself honestly — what are you doing to help the situation or handle it effectively? Are you being open and honest with the person bringing you down? Are you doing everything you can, every day, to find a new job?

Chances are you could be trying harder to fix your problems. Not sure how? Well there’s a great website, called Google, and it can answer pretty much any question you ask it. Try it out!

Understand and accept that you aren’t perfect, no one is, and so you’ll need to put ***continuous effort*** in to bettering yourself if you want to live a good life. Make a commitment today to improve the areas of your life that are causing you the most pain, or to achieve the goals that you know will bring you the most joy.

No matter how long it takes, no matter how many times you fail, you will always get back up and do whatever it takes to chase your vision. Just imagine what life would be like if you really tried your absolute best to achieve the things you really want.

It won’t happen overnight and it certainly won’t be easy, but that’s okay because its not the reward that makes you happy — ***its the chase!*** The moment you make that commitment and start acting on it, a huge weight will be lifted from your shoulders and you will feel more energised and alive than ever before.

You’re doing everything you can to make something of yourself and its only a matter of time before you get to where you want to be, and what a great feeling that is!

**What can I do today?**

Using notes on your phone, or a notebook, answer these 3 questions:

1. *If success is a guarantee, what will my life look like 2 years from now?*

* Where do you live? What do you do for a living? What does an average week look like? What do you look like? How would you describe yourself? What’s different about your relationships with those closest to you? What friends do you have and what are their personalities?

*2. What negative aspects of my life will be gone?*

* Do you eat fast food 7 days a week? Do you want to quit smoking? Are you in a toxic relationship you need to fix or break off? Do you hate your current job?

***3. **What will I need to do to achieve the life I have laid out for myself above?*

* To stop eating fast food 7 days a week, you’ll need to start cooking your own meals. If you don’t know how to cook, you’re going to have to learn. To fix a relationship, you may need to start communicating with them more effectively or simply make more of an effort to understand and spend quality time with them.

Spend as long as you like fantasising about the vision you have created. Keep these notes handy and revisit them regularly, especially whenever you feel like you have gone off the rails.

### Quit complaining and be grateful

We’ve already established that life is hard and unfair. For this reason, it’s extremely easy to fall in to the trap of constantly complaining about the negative aspects of our existence.

Ask yourself when the last time you complained was and it was probably today. Small annoyances such as traffic, slow internet or someone being unnecessarily rude to us can ruin our whole day! If this sounds like you, then I have news for you…

**YOU ARE MAKING YOURSELF MISERABLE!**

If you complain every time something doesn’t go your way, you will put yourself in a bad mood almost every day. Not only that, but you’ll always seem to find more things to complain about and end up saying things like “its just one thing after another!” and “why is it always me?!”.

You are always in control of how you react to any situation. Choosing to highlight any difficulty that comes your way is counter-productive if you want to live a happy, stress-free life.

As mentioned earlier, the best thing to do in any situation is to ask yourself, “can I do anything to change this?”. If there’s nothing you can do — suck it up, get over it and move forward. If there’s something you can do, either attempt to change it or get the fuck over it!

Do not confuse complaining with venting. Complaining is expressing annoyance or dissatisfaction, whereas venting is freely expressing your emotions about a particular situation.

Venting to someone who cares is a great way of getting things off your chest and relieving the pain of difficult circumstances. Complaining is only going to make things worse and no one enjoys hearing you whine about the trivial problems in your life (and if they do, you shouldn’t spend time with them).

The truth is, as we grow up no one ever explains to us that we should deliberately and purposefully refine the way we think, so it’s no wonder that most of us pick up negative thought patterns throughout our lives. But we can change this, and quickly too!

To fix this, we need to focus more on appreciating the things that are going well. It comes naturally to complain about the bad stuff, but there are outstanding things that happen every day that often go unappreciated.

When was the last time you showed your gratitude for a delightful interaction with someone, an unusual lack of traffic or the existence of a relationship that means a lot to you?

Reprogram your brain to stop focusing on the negatives and start highlighting the positives, especially the little things. I promise it will make you a lot happier and you will brighten the lives of everybody around you, as you become a pleasure to spend time with.

**What can I do today?**

Open notes on your phone or take a notebook and write down today’s date and ‘3 things I’m grateful for today:’

Then proceed to note down the 3 things that you’re grateful for today. Don’t over complicate it, these 3 things could be anything, as explanative as you want:

* I’m grateful for my parents, they are the only people in the world that love me unconditionally and have always worked hard to ensure that I have a roof over my head. No one else has ever showed me support like them and I really don’t know where I’d be without it!

* I’m grateful for my Amazon Kindle, I can buy books cheaper than I would buy paperbacks and its ease-of-use means I read more consistently and effectively.

* I’m grateful for this cup of coffee I’m drinking, it tastes great!

Now attempt to do this every morning before you leave the house, and every day you will walk with a spring in your step as you begin to realise the beauty of the world around you, and of life itself.

### Focus on your own life, not the lives of others

We are living in an era like none before. In the past 10 years, the world has become more connected than ever and this has had catastrophic side effects on all of us. I plan to write more about this in the future, as this is something I feel very strongly about, but for now let me just summarise the **unaddressed epidemic** that is silently destroying society every day.

You’re most likely reading this article from a smartphone, and if you own a smartphone then you probably have at least one social media account. How much time do you spend on social media? Let’s say 2 hours a day on average. Thats 14 hours a week, 728 hours a year.

You are spending 1/8th of your waking hours, swiping up and down with your thumb, doing one of two things: begging for the attention of others or sacrificing your own attention. Imagine if you spent that time playing the guitar. Or reading books. Yet some still have the audacity to say “I don’t have time”.

If you’re on Twitter, you’re either trying to show people how funny, clever or unique you are. If you’re on Instagram, you’re either trying to make people think you’re sexy or give them the impression that you have an amazing life. If you’re on Facebook then you’re either sharing stupid videos or ranting over something trivial.

When is the last time you went longer than 72 hours without using social media? It has likely been months, *or even years*, because these apps have became our main source of fulfilment and entertainment.

We know it’s affecting us, yet we stay because we are dependent on the platforms to keep in touch with the people we care about. But is that really the case? Do we really need to know what 100s of people are up to, every single day? And if so, are these benefits worth an addiction that takes up 1/8th of your existence?

**Bear in mind that time is all we truly own.**

Not only are these apps highly addictive, but they are dangerous and harmful to our wellbeing. Never in human history have so many of us been anxious or depressed — especially the younger generations, who have literally never known anything besides selfies, memes and likes.

![The amount of girls between 10–14 being admitted to hospital for deliberate self harm has TRIPLED in 10 years!](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4608/1*GzLxgnh0vO9CGncn6XGa_A.png)*The amount of girls between 10–14 being admitted to hospital for deliberate self harm has TRIPLED in 10 years!*

The graph above disgusts me. This is not a future I want for the world and it is certainly not a future I want for myself, or my future children. It is simply unsustainable to continue using social media the way we do. What will society be like when the 10–14 year olds in graph above are now 30 and in control of the world?
> # *Quit social media and get your life, attention and emotional-stability back sooner, rather than later.*

Fight your addiction to your smartphone, it’s making you a depressed zombie filled with anxiety. The evidence is clear. At the very least, take more notice of the toxicity of social media and the new, always-connected phenomenon. Compulsive use of your smartphone is simply unnecessary and is the most harmful habit you can allow to continue if you want to live a fulfilling life.

Stop worrying about what other people are up to, at all. Don’t compare yourself with anyone who seems to have it together — most of us don’t, we’re just either pretending or trying our best.

***Compare yourself only to the person you were yesterday.***

Don’t be a pretender, focus on your own life and aim to become the best version of yourself. If anything is worth doing, its that.

**What can I do today?**

Start limiting your usage of social media and start spending more time alone with your own thoughts. If you can’t handle that, at least try to read a book instead.

Sign up to your local martial arts gym, start taking salsa classes or simply find entertainment from something other than memes, Netflix or YouTube.

If social media scares you as much as it does myself, you can go the extra mile and remove it from your life. Unfortunately, due to the way the apps are designed, it is nearly impossible to use them responsibly. To truly free yourself from your addiction, it may be necessary to delete your accounts or even get rid of your smartphone altogether, that’s what I did.

## Summary

To become the best version of yourself, start by **taking responsibility for your circumstances.** To do this, you must:

* Make a commitment to improve yourself physically and mentally, and to always get back up, no matter how many times you fall.

* Stop complaining about things that don’t matter and instead start showing more gratitude for the good things in life.

* Focus on your own life and stop comparing yourself to others. Compare yourself only to the person you were yesterday. Limit social media’s role in your life.

This is my first Medium article and if even one reader has gained the slightest bit of value from what I have written then I am more than ecstatic!

I’m looking forward to continue writing and make it a regular thing, starting with How To Become The Best Version Of Yourself In 2019: Part Two.

Thank you for reading.
